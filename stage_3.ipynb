              "\" The energy transition is very much about how far and how fast electrification can go. Siemens Energy is involved in most electrification technologies, from conventional and renewable power generation to storage, grids and green hydrogen production. To understand the issues, risks and opportunities, Energy Intelligence Senior Reporter Philippe Roos caught up with Stefan Diezinger, in charge of Sustainable Energy Systems at the German energy giant Industrial Applications division ( related). Q: Industrial carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced with energy efficiency. What the potential there? A: We see efficiency enhancement as an important part of decarbonizing industries, especially energy-intensive process industries. We still see a lot of old equipment which has 30, 40 or even 50 years of operation, even in Germany. With an upgrade, you can easily get 20% more efficiency. If you put this in terms of CO2 avoidance costs, it is extremely attractive. Then there so much waste heat which is not efficiently used and dumped in many rivers, even in Europe. High-temperature heat pumps can address this. They're enabling to have 150°C hot water, which can be used in many processes. We're getting so many requests at the moment because it’ s a low-hanging fruit. There are also a lot of residual gases which are hydrogen-rich and are flared, even in Europe. With today technologies, you can make productive use of those gases. For example, you can use them in a fuel-flexible gas turbine to generate power. Like this, you can get 5% -10% efficiency improvement, which also means CO2 reduction. Everybody wants to talk about hydrogen but a lot of CO2 reduction can be accomplished now through modernization and stepwise improvements. There another point that we have identified, especially in the oil and gas industry, which has a strong focus on high availability [ of systems to improve efficiency ]. This is often secured with highly redundant systems with multiple units. I remember a project where a customer bought several gas turbines from us, including two for backup. These machines are running at 60% -70% load factor or below, which reduces efficiency, only to cover two to three days a year of peak demand. Nowadays, there are new options to cover peak demand while letting turbines operate within their optimum operating range at much higher efficiency, without compromising availability. To find the optimal configuration for a specific application, sophisticated design algorithms and a broad toolbox of technologies are available -- including equipment, electrification, automation and digitalization. This is very easy. And from a cost perspective, it is a low-hanging fruit. Q: How can you incentivize companies to invest more in efficiency? A: You can put a price on inefficiency. A CO2 price or what under discussion in Europe, a carbon border adjustment mechanism, is basically a price on inefficiency. We have at the moment ongoing discussions with companies in different parts of the world. They want to decarbonize not because they have a domestic CO2 price or want to be green, but because they are concerned about a negative impact on exports of carbon-intensive products, particularly to Europe. Q: Beyond energy efficiency, what can industries do in the future to cut emissions? A: Everybody wants to talk about hydrogen. But if you really go into the details of the hydrogen business case, you can clearly see it only makes sense if there is a substantial amount of renewable power at very low cost. If this is the case, you can produce green hydrogen or other green molecules like methanol and use them to replace fossil feedstock in the chemical industry and the mobility sector. But fuel shifting is not necessarily just about hydrogen. For example, even in Europe you still have a large amount of coal-fired boilers. People don't realize this. Replacing these coal-fired boilers with highly efficient gas-fired combined heat and power plants can save you 20% -30% in CO2 emissions. That extremely attractive from an economic point of view. And these technologies are hydrogen ready. If cheap hydrogen from cheap renewable power becomes available, you can switch from pure natural gas and blend hydrogen into it. This is a way of having reliable production, with reliable power and reliable heat. Q: If we get more and more renewable power and if it getting cheaper and cheaper, wouldn't it make more sense to just electrify everything instead of going the hydrogen route? A: Most industrial processes can be electrified. For example, we see a tendency to replace mechanical drives with electrical drives. Heat can be also be produced electrically. We have the technologies. You can even electrify steam crackers. Cracking is a very established process, but companies like BASF are now talking about electrical crackers. But you d need massive amounts of electric power. So, it not so much of a technology topic, it about getting all this renewable power and bringing it to industrial production sites. And there a second condition, or limitation: you need to build new equipment. You can modify a conventional cracker to optimize efficiency, not to electrify it. So technically, everything is possible, but to electrify everything, you need a lot of cheap renewable power generation, and you need transmission lines. Then you need to make significant investment to electrify production. This is a lot of steps. Q: So, are you suggesting industries may need hydrogen as an intermediary step between the present situation and a fully electrified future? A: Yes, because it will take time and money to make enough renewable power and have the transmission lines. And there will be other sectors which will get that power first, for example the mobility sector. And hydrogen is no silver bullet, let be very clear. It one part of a large toolbox. There will be many different ways to make our processes more energy efficient. We ll work on system design to get the efficiency out. Hydrogen will also play a role in heat production. And the beauty of it is you can produce a lot of molecules out of it, which we're used to dealing with, such as green methanol or green methane. Q: If availability of enough renewable electricity is an issue, does it mean that blue hydrogen from natural gas, which doesn't involve electricity, has a big role to play? A: I believe there space for all technologies. Blue hydrogen will definitely play a role, at least as an intermediate step. The green hydrogen route is attractive in locations where you have ideal conditions for renewable power such as North Africa, Australia or Chile, but only a few spots in Europe, the US or China where you have the largest demand centers. There also something that we are starting to realize: we ll need a lot of carbon atoms for the many projects we have to produce e-fuels. If you have hydrogen and want to produce green hydrocarbons, you ll need carbon atoms. So there will be a utilization market for the CO2 captured during blue hydrogen production. There will definitely be a need for this. Q: Will carbon capture also play a role to decarbonize industrial processes such as steel production? A: There is not one answer. We're having this discussion with different steel producers. It depends on the CO2 price, the electricity price and the ability at a given spot to produce cheap green hydrogen. And there another parameter: are your offtakers willing to pay a premium for green steel? Or are they forced to do so by regulation? Q: How important is digitalization for the energy transition? A: To solve the challenge that we have in front of us, you need three ingredients. First of all, you need to have an extensive toolbox of portfolio elements. We are not only a turbine company. We also have energy storage. Together with Gamesa, we have a very good portfolio of renewable power generation. We have various technologies for heat generation and utilization, like high-temperature heat pumps. We have microgrids, and we have electrification. We have an automation portfolio. And digital. The second ingredient is you need to have the expertise and competence to combine these elements in the right way, plus the competence to understand regulations. You need, for example, to understand the incentives and penalties and where the CO2 price is going toward. And third, coming to your point, to do this on a large scale you need to have the right software tools. Optimizing all these technical, economic and regulatory parameters at the same time is challenging due to the many variables. So digitalization is important in the design phase. We can also make use of big data in predictive maintenance. It allows us to say maintenance can be done three months later than planned because everything still looks fine, or two months earlier because something looks strange. With digitalization, we can also optimize operations in an online mode. If somebody has a smart idea, we can look, go into the operation pattern and do it online. We are investing heavily in this. Q: You mentioned turbines. Is running a gas turbine on hydrogen an issue? A: It is not a technological issue anymore, it an economic decision. Technically, it under control. We already have one of our major gas turbines, the SGT-800, which can operate with 75% hydrogen. To be very clear, it challenging to find a spot where you get that much hydrogen, so hydrogen supply is the bottleneck, not the turbine technology. Now if you wanted to use 100% hydrogen, you would have some challenges on the physics side, but 75% already brings a large amount of CO2 reduction. And the hydrogen economy needs a lot of other things to be done. You need to have the pipelines, you need to have the production, you need the renewables. Q: Do you think we need a new hydrogen infrastructure? A: Once again, there is no one answer. There are many spots suitable for building hydrogen pipelines or upgrading existing pipelines for hydrogen transport. Another option is to convert hydrogen into molecules we know how to deal with, such as liquids or methane, whereby we already have a working infrastructure. Moreover, you can make green molecules out of green hydrogen, and in many regards it better to transport such green molecules rather than hydrogen itself. Q: Will the industry use a lot of these green molecules? A: If we're ramping up production, most liquid green molecules will be used as chemical feedstock and to decarbonize transport. We may need to build up a massive industry to produce green jet fuel. In road transport, electric cars will prevail, especially in the 50-100 [ 30 - 60 mile ] kilometer range. Still, it will be difficult with batteries for long distances and goods, and I believe the answer will involve green liquid molecules. Q: Rather than gaseous hydrogen? A: Cracking them back, say from methanol back to hydrogen, would mean losing part of the energy content in the process. Q: You also mentioned energy storage. Are you looking at different options? A: There will be three technologies for storing energy. One is straightforward batteries. Besides mobile applications like cars, there will be medium-scale applications in grid stabilization, especially at industrial sites. Industries can not allow fluctuation in their production process if the grid is fluctuating, so they will likely invest in batteries. The second technology is thermal storage, which is very attractive because it is robust and cheap. I m not talking about molten salt, but about concrete, rock. If there nothing rotating, there not a lot of maintenance. It suitable for storing renewable energy on a massive industrial scale, maybe not to turn it back into electricity but for heat. There are many processes, also in the future, where we need heat and steam, for which the economics of thermal storage are excellent. We already have a rock-based storage operating in Hamburg, and a partnership in Norway with EnergyNest, for concrete-based storage. The third way of storing energy is in molecules. Hydrogen is a way of storing energy. You can take renewable power, and store it in hydrogen or some other green molecule coming from hydrogen. All of these technologies will have uses in different applications. \""

              "' New US President Joe Biden took office this week with the US-China relationship at its worst in decades. Energy has come to play a bigger role in that relationship than ever before, and rising Chinese imports of US oil and LNG could serve as the foundation for fresh discussions on trade -- one of the few areas where US-China communications have not completely broken down. But tackling climate change, a priority for Biden unlike predecessor Donald Trump, may offer the easiest and biggest opportunity for cooperation between the two powers now. Due to a bipartisan perception that China’ s economic, geopolitical and technological rise poses an existential threat to the US, a Biden administration is unlikely to soften the tone on Beijing. Trump demanded bigger purchases of US energy products by China as part of a Phase 1 trade deal before he would lift US tariffs on Chinese products. After Biden won the November US presidential election, Trump moved into high gear to crack down on the perceived Chinese military threat. In the energy sphere, this included sanctions against China National Offshore Oil Corp. ( CNOOC), which was characterized as a Chinese military-controlled company and targeted for aggressive encroachments in disputed waters of the South China Sea. After banning US investors from trading CNOOC shares in early December, the administration’ s parting shot last week was to ban the sale of US technology to CNOOC and its subsidiaries. With many exemptions in place, the measure may seem limited in scope but could hinder CNOOC’ s ability to develop its domestic offshore resources, unless Biden reverses it. Last year’ s Phase 1 trade deal entailed China spending an unrealistically high $ 18.5 billion above the 2017 baseline on US energy products, a goal made all the more impossible by China’ s demand plunge from the coronavirus and sharply lower oil prices. But Beijing has shown goodwill, withdrawing import tariffs on US liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG), crude and LNG and encouraging oil purchases through unofficial subsidies last summer ( PIW Aug.1420). The 2021 energy import targets are even more daunting than the 2020 goals, and Beijing is no more inclined than Washington to come to the negotiating table with a gift in hand. The future trajectory of China imports of US energy will largely depend on whether they make commercial sense while Beijing assesses how Biden approaches the relationship. China’ s imports of US crude jumped 211% in 2020 to a record 396,000 barrels per day, a trade worth $ 6.27 billion, according to the Chinese customs administration. Meanwhile, imports of US LNG reached 3.32 million tons, worth $ 1.11 billion, up from a lone shipment in 2019, and 4.2 million tons of US LPG was discharged in China, for $ 1.74 billion, up from zero in 2019. The total value of these energy imports was $ 9.12 billion -- equal to the 2017 baseline. This leaves China with the daunting task of importing an extra $ 52.4 billion of US energy products this year to meet its Phase 1 target. Shipping data suggest China’ s US crude imports at 407,000 b/d for January, down from 851,000 b/d in December, according to Kpler. “ They are going to wait and see the policy under the Biden administration, ” said Energy Aspects analyst Yuntao Liu. Shipping data suggest China’ s US crude imports at 407,000 b/d for January, down from 851,000 b/d in December, according to Kpler. US LNG sales to China have fared better with 1.1 million tons expected in Chinese ports this month, slightly more than in December, but this is more likely the result of freezing temperatures than driven by politics ( related). With the dramatic change in tone in the White House on climate change, symbolized by the US rejoining the Paris climate accord this week, opportunities may widen beyond the oil and gas trade that could help rebuild dialogue between Washington and Beijing. China stole a march on the US in September in announcing plans to be carbon-neutral by 2060. Whereas Trump, a staunch supporter for fossil fuels, shrugged off climate change entirely, Biden has an ambitious green agenda that targets carbon neutrality by 2050. But old trade gripes could surface here, too, as competition to gain first-mover advantage and develop leading green technologies intensifies ( PIW Jan.1521). '"
